# System-Analysis-and-Design

The DriverPass project was a general software development project for a made-up client, a non-profit group that works to make roads safer. They asked you to create an online system that would help students, teachers, and administrators communicate with each other and keep track of driver's education records.

I would do better in this area by producing higher-fidelity prototypes that give the development team a more comprehensive visual guide and more accurately depict the user experience.

I want to go over the user interface mockups again and include more intricate and interactive components. Making higher-fidelity prototypes that more accurately depict the user experience and give the development team a more comprehensive visual guide would be my improvement in this area.

Prioritizing user needs is crucial because it guarantees that the final product will not only function but also be beneficial, simple to use, and eventually utilized by the target market.

I design software by first performing a thorough analysis of requirements to determine the system scope, followed by designing data and architectural models to plan its structure. In the future, I would incorporate more advanced techniques like domain-driven design and use collaborative modeling tools to make the analysis and design phase better.
